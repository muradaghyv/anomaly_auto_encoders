There are things that need to be done:
1) Data analysis and preparation steps, like encoding and scaling should be done in each training and validation, also test sets so that they are compatible with each other.
2) Model creation and building should be done more accurately and deeper for accurate and better results. It will give us more control over the model. It is better work with the .py files rather than .ipynb files.
